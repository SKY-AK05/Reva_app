# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a feature-complete Flutter mobile application for Reva, an AI-powered productivity assistant. The mobile app will serve as a companion to the existing Next.js web application, providing users with a native mobile experience while maintaining full feature parity and real-time synchronization.

The mobile app will leverage the existing Supabase backend infrastructure and AI processing capabilities, focusing on delivering a chat-first interface optimized for mobile interactions, offline capabilities, and push notifications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Authentication System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to securely log into my Reva account on mobile using the same credentials as the web app, so that I can access my data across all devices.

4. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL securely store the session token locally
5. WHEN the app is reopened THEN the system SHALL automatically authenticate using stored credentials
6. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all local session data and cached content
7. WHEN a stored session expires THEN the system SHALL attempt silent refresh; IF refresh fails THEN prompt login
8. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages with specific guidance (network vs credentials vs permissions)

### Requirement 2: Chat Interface (Primary UI)

4. WHEN an expense is added on the web app THEN the system SHALL sync the new expense to mobile in real-time
5. WHEN a user taps on an expense THEN the system SHALL allow editing of expense details
6. WHEN the system calculates totals THEN it SHALL display accurate spending summaries by category and date
7. WHEN the device is offline THEN the system SHALL show cached expenses but disable modifications

### Requirement 5: Reminder System with Push Notifications
